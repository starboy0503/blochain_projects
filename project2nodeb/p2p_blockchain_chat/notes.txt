To test multi-node chat:

Open a second terminal, start another node on a different port:

PORT=5001 python node.py


Now you have:

Node 1 â†’ http://127.0.0.1:5000

Node 2 â†’ http://127.0.0.1:5001

Register them as peers. From Node 1:

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/peers/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"host": "http://127.0.0.1:5001"}'


From Node 2:

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/peers/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"host": "http://127.0.0.1:5000"}'


Open two clients, one pointing to each node:

python pyqt-client.py --port 5000
python pyqt-client.py --port 5001


Now, when you send "hello" from one client, the other should receive it via the blockchain transaction broadcast ðŸŽ¯
